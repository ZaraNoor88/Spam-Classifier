# Spam-Classifier
This is a supervised learning binary classification project. This project uses an SMS spam dataset with 5,574 messages tagged with spam or ham. We build a machine learning model using Naive Bayes and compare its results with other classification algorithms. But Naive Bayes outperformed with 97% accuracy and 100% precision.
